# 🌱 Crop Detection Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Crop Detection System** that uses Machine Learning to identify crop types based on various features such as soil type, weather conditions, and nutrient values. The system helps farmers and researchers by recommending the most suitable crop for cultivation or by detecting the crop from input images/data.
